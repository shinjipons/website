# The basics

If you don't know what Obsidian is, it's a note taking application for desktop and mobile based on markdown files. I love it because of its file over app philosophy, its simplicity, speed and incredible plugins that allow me to customize the user interface and experience to my exact liking.

As opposed to other note-taking apps, you can make Obsidian **yours** through extensive customization and careful plugin use.
