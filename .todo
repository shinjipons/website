To do (in order)
- [x] write my first blog post
    - [x] add vercel analytics the blog post layout
- [ ] add an interactive canvas populated with my last 10 raindrop likes
- [ ] add a 3D model that rotates as you scroll up/down the main page
- [ ] it would be sick to hook up a notion database to a collection in Astro (for example, my life timeline into a section or something)
- [ ] figure out how to do image compression thru Vercel
- [ ] (won't do) add elevenlabs bottom bar playback on the blog articles (probably costs money...)
