To do (in order)

- [ ] add archive and scrap content
    - [ ] create a way to make a nice gallery like on Read.cv (saved on #minimal_portfolio_research in Raindrop)
- [ ] add an interactive canvas populated with my last 10 raindrop likes
- [ ] add a simple 3D model that rotates as you scroll up/down the main page
- [ ] figure out how to do image compression thru Vercel

- [x] write my first blog post
- [x] add vercel analytics the blog post layout

Won't do

- [ ] add a way to hook up Figma's API to a line of text on the website ("This week, I created 289 frames in Figma")
- [ ] hook up a notion database to a collection in Astro (for example, my life timeline into a section or something)
- [ ] add elevenlabs bottom bar playback on the blog articles (probably costs money...)
